I implemented it with the colorscheme i have and think it looks pretty good. May play around with it some more as I develop the site, but think it could be cooler than just a plain background.\n\nNext I am going to deploy the site to my S3 bucket, and continue planning / designing further progress."}},{"metadata":{"tags":[]},"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"c7u3lavwvjo5"}},"id":"4zBmFCzYe1AfHNFAjbjCF","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2022-06-03T01:56:02.994Z","updatedAt":"2022-06-03T03:00:57.110Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"devNotes"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"date":"6/02/2022","title":"starting the site out","description":"- I drew up some vague designs in my notebook of the plain splash page, that will redirect users to these notes. \n- Got the color scheme from [coolors](coolors.co) , I use it all the time. \n- Learned Sass variables better and got the palette all in variables.\n- Hooked up the notes pages to this CMS\n\nNow that I've got the basics up for show, I have to design the rest of the site, and figure out what content I want to include.\n\nThe goal of this is to be different from just an online portfolio or resume. I want this site to be a more interactive where I can display my past experience / interests / hobbies in a more fun way.
